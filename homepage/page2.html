          <p>The history  a place has, has a great impact not only on the people but the space. This history influences us to this day, creating and empowering communities. Where people can heal and grow. Tsion Cafe. An Ethiopian Mediterranean restaurant located in Harlem is a safe space for me. The cafe's history is extremely fascinating and crucial and plays an important role on how the cafe is perceived today. Malcolm X, one of the main contributors towards black liberation and the equality for all worked here, washing dishes. This was way before he was “Malcolm X '' but he worked here with Redd Fox, a black comedian who was also influential during the civil rights movement. People like Billie Holiday and many others came here to dine. Jimmy’s Chicken  shack was a place where black people felt safe and were able to eat food without the constant fear of being racially attacked. This history is crucial, not only due to the monumental figures but the safeness this place held.
            And to this day Tsion Cafe has held tightly onto the feeling of being safe and included for all. I watched this place being built into what it is now, it used to be a large cluttered mess where nobody went. But my mom saw faith and it and got to work, spending endless nights and days creating the image she had in her head. After a year in construction it was done. My mom would be able to show all the parts of her culture through the food that she served.
             Born in Ethiopia, my mom had to flee the country when she was 7 due to governmental injustices.She walked from Ethiopia to Sudan and from there was taken to Israel where she grew up. Within the menu we see the journey of my mom's journey. The Veggie Combo which is a classic Ethiopian dish, shows the proud Ethiopian heritage my mother has. Meanwhile the shakshuka and the ful were dishes she was introduced either in Sudan or israel. After service in the Israeli army my mom traveled, mainly to South america. Which then influenced her to include alfajores on the menu. Which was a cookie she ate a lot during her adventures within Peru. Then eventually coming back to new york therefore influencing the burger and locks on bagels on the menu.
            This is special to me because I am a part of my mom. It's like the stories she tells me about her travels or experiences come to life as I eat the foods that apply to the story. Which goes back to the point of how food is a universal language and a way of unification. It can bring people of all backgrounds together, so having a restaurant with such a large variety you are able to watch these connections form and blossom. I worked at the cafe last summer, and I was able to learn skills I never had before. But I was also able to hear people's stories. People from all over the world sharing their own unique stories is extremely special and valuable. Which is why Tsion cafe resembles my New York.
